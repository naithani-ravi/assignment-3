<p>My name is Doctor Womac and I am going to teach you all about chemical formulae. A chemical formula is a way to describe the chemical elements that make up a particular chemical compound. It consists of chemical symbols to covey the elements and numbers to show the number of atoms of each element. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is the chemical formula for sulphur for example. The charge of an ion can be displayed in superscript, such as Au<sup>2+</sup>. This concludes my lesson. I must rush off home now because I have a problem with some radioactive phosphate.</p>
